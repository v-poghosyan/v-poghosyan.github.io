    "\n",
    "We are given a pipe system represented by a 2D rectangular grid of cells. There are three different types of items located in the cells within the grid, with each having either no Items or 1 Item:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Source:** There is 1 source in the system. It is represented by the asterisk character `*`.\n",
    "* **Sinks:** There are an arbitrary number of sinks in the system. They are each represented by a different uppercase letter (`A`, `B`, `C`, etc.).\n",
    "* **Pipes:** There are 10 different shapes of pipes, represented by the following characters: `═`, `║`, `╔`, `╗`, `╚`, `╝`, `╠`, `╣`, `╦`, `╩`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Each pipe has openings on 2 or 3 sides of its cell.\n",
    "* Two adjacent cells are connected if both have a pipe opening at their shared edge.\n",
    "* We should treat the source and sinks as having pipe openings at all of their edges. For example, the two cells `A╦` are connected through their shared edge, but the two cells `B╔` are not.\n",
    "* A sink may be connected to the source through another sink. For example, in the simple pipe system `*A═B=C`, all three sinks are connected to the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to write a function that determines which sinks are connected to the source in a given pipe system.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider the following pipe system:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "*╗ ╦═A\n",
    " ╠═╝\n",
    " C ╚═B\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this pipe system, the source `*` is connected to sinks `A` and `C` but not `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a system is specified by an input text file in the following format.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "*02\n",
    "C10\n",
    "╠11\n",
    "╗12\n",

DFS is better suited for just finding a *valid* path, or *all* valid paths (in which case we could throw in backtracking as well). Since we're interested in a valid path between the source `*` and *any* given sink, and not necessarily the shortest such path, we use DFS (possibly with backtracking) for this problem.\n",
