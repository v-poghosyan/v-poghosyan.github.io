    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post we use [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) external scripts to render 3D scenes inside this Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "This post will be very similar, in terms of its stack, to the [D3.js interactive US map post](../d3_in_jupyter_with_deno/d3_js_in_jupyter_with_deno.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In *that* post, we learned that Canvas and SVG are two ways in which we can display complex graphics inside a web browser. We already explored SVG graphics in [D3.js interactive US map](../d3_in_jupyter_with_deno/d3_js_in_jupyter_with_deno.ipynb). It's worth noting that a lot of the same functionality could've been replicated using the HTML Canvas element instead of SVG (which we ultimately chose for its superior interactive capabilities) -- the article mentions one way to do that by using [skia-canvas](https://github.com/samizdatco/skia-canvas). \n",
    "\n",
    "We ended up using [linkedom](https://github.com/WebReflection/linkedom#readme) to add a DOM API on top of the Deno environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, what I realized later on is that we could've simply used the Markdown inside our Jupyter notebook to create the `<svg>` element without the need to introduce a third-party DOM API on top of a browser-less JavaScript environment (Deno). Then, we could have simply fetched the `TopoJSON` data and constructed the map inside our external scripts with the rest of the complex D3 animations that had to be added as external scripts. \n",
    "These scripts are run by Quarto only *after* the page has been rendered to the browser, so we can easily reference the DOM elements we create inside our notes by `class` or `id`. Crucially, the external scripts are meant to run *inside the browser* (as opposed to being pre-computed in the browser-less Deno environment). Inside the browser they're able to leverage the existing DOM API provided by the browser's engine (e.g. `document.getElementById`). Hence, this way, we eliminate the need for Deno as well as Linkedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the [IPython.display](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/8.26.0/api/generated/IPython.display.html) module to create HTML elements inside our notes rather than just using Markdown directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Three.js, WebGL, and Canvas API\n",
    "\n",
    "[Three.js](https://threejs.org/) is a library for drawing 3D graphics in the browser using JavaScript and [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/) (see [wiki](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Main_Page)). One excellent resource for learning WebGL is the [WebGLFundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons) website.\n",
    "\n",
    "WebGL runs in an HTML Canvas (i.e. `<canvas>`). \n",
    "\n",
    "From the WebGL wiki: \n",
    "\n",
    "> WebGL is a DOM API, which means that it can be used in any DOM-compatible language: e.g. JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Three.js is a library that provides conveniences in JavaScript that abstract much of this [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) DOM API calls behind friendlier JavaScript code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that WebGL and Canvas API are two distinct ways in which the browser draws graphics, but they both require and HTML Canvas to draw on. Three.js offers a WebGL renderer as well as a Canvas renderer. Canvas API is usually a fallback option for when WebGL, the more powerful of the two APIs, isn't available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, also, that Three.js isn't suitable for modelling purposes, for that we can use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) or a number of other closed-source 3D modelling applications. We can even download or purchase third-party models from vendors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Canvas and SVG elements are two ways in which we can display complex graphics inside a web browser. We already explored SVG graphics in the [D3.js interactive US Map](../d3_in_jupyter_with_deno/d3_js_in_jupyter_with_deno.ipynb) post. It's worth noting that a lot of the same functionality could've been achieved by using the HTML Canvas element with D3.js instead. The post above mentions one way to do that by using [skia-canvas](https://github.com/samizdatco/skia-canvas). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post we use Three.js, and not D3.js, to draw inside an HTML Canvas element using, not the Canvas API, but rather WebGL.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3D Scenes - A Primer\n",
    "\n",
    "In *any* 3D scene, be it in the web browser, inside a game engine, in a movie, in a 3D modelling application, etc. there are a bunch of **geometries**, or **shapes** that are packaged with **materials** as **meshes**. The materials can describe simple properties like reflectivity, opacity, refraction index, etc. or they can be  **textures** which are just simple [raster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) images. We can also apply **shaders** to our objects, which are complex mappings of pixels (or vertices) that make up an interesting animation.\n",
    " \n",
    "A scene will also have one or more **light sources**, and a **camera** to *serve* the scene in some perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Meshes, Objects, Geometries, and Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "An `object`, for the foreseeable future, means an object file of the [OBJ Wavefront format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file). These are files that consist of `object.children[n].geometry` and `object.children[n].material` fields. However, the material fields inside an OBJ are just *references* (via `usemtl` statements) to the true materials which come separately in `.mtl` files (typically from the same place as the `.obj` file).\n",
    "\n",
    "There's usually no need to break the object down into individual child geometries and their corresponding objects. But, it's certainly possible. One use case would be if we want to apply a different transformation to each component. Usually, however, we load the object as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Our First Canvas\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a `<canvas>` with `id=\"three-d-canvas\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do it either using raw markup below this very cell, or by using the `IPython.display` module which allows us to display rich representations of objects in a Jupyter notebook (much like the `Deno.jupyter.display` module we saw in the [D3.js US map post](../d3_in_jupyter_with_deno/d3_js_in_jupyter_with_deno.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `IPython.display` is more reliable."

    "What good is rendering a skybox if we can't zoom and pan around to experience it in 3D? [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls) allow us to do just that! Let's add them to our scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "`OrbitControls` can be imported from the following CDN:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<script src=\"https://cdn.skypack.dev/three@0.133.0/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js\"></script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "As with all Three.js add-ons so far, we import `OrbitControls` using Quarto's front-matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once it's imported, we add `OrbitControls` to our scene.\n",

    "```js\n",
    "// Add OrbitControls\n",

    "controls.enableDamping = true; // Smooth damping effect during rotation\n",
    "controls.dampingFactor = 0.05;\n",
    "```\n",
    "The line `const controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement)` passes `renderer.domElement` instead of just `renderer` because `OrbitControls` needs a DOM element to attach event listeners to (for mouse or touch interactions), not a renderer object. A Three.js rendering object manages the WebGL context, `renderer.domElement` is the actual HTML Canvas element to which Three.js renders the scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, inside the `animate()` call, we need to ensure that we're updating `CubeCamera`'s environment map. This is done to retain realistic reflections on shiny objects. Reflective objects show surrounding environment reflected on their surfaces, so the `CubeMap` needs to be updated whenever the scene changes in order to keep reflections on objects accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The animate block, which previously looked like:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function animate() {\n",
    "  requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n",
    "  object.rotation.y += 0.01;\n",
    "  renderer.render(scene, camera);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Becomes:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function animate() {\n",
    "  requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n",
    "  object.rotation.y += 0.01;\n",
    "  cubeCamera.update(renderer, scene);  \n",
    "  renderer.render(scene, camera);\n",
    "  controls.update();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The line `conrols.update()` is required the animation loop to ensure smooth interaction and rendering. Without this call, the camera might not respond to user input correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, now that we have `OrbitControls`, let's ensure we're positioning the camera to show the duck at the start of our scene. This is done within the `OBJLoader` callback, where the `object` is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "camera5.position.copy(object.position);  // Set camera at duck position\n",
    "camera5.position.y += 20;  // Add y-offset (adjust value as needed)\n",
    "camera5.position.z += -20  // Add z-offset offset (adjust value as needed)\n",
    "camera5.lookAt(object.position) // Orient the camera to look at the duck\n",
    "```\n",

    "Go ahead and try the controls in the canvas above. Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Right mouse button (RMB) to pan\n",
    "* Left mouse button (LMB) to rotate\n",
    "* Scroll wheel (SW) to zoom\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on to creating more complex scenes, with multiple objects, we should explore how an OBJ file represents an object. We will need to understand the structure of an Object to manipulate it correctly using Three.js. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will do that in an upcoming update!"
