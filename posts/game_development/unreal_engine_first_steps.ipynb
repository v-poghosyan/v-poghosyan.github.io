    "# Getting Started (Installation and Setup)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Option 1: Cloning `UnrealEngine` Project from Github\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps are meant broadly as the specific instructions might change over time. You will need to download the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the Unreal Engine [website](https://www.unrealengine.com/). \n",
    "2. Register an account.\n",
    "3. Request access to the [GitHub org](https://github.com/EpicGames)\n",
    "4. Fork the [UnrealEngine](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine) repo and clone to local\n",
    "5. Follow the README to compile and run the Unreal Editor. The Editor uses a version of the Unreal Engine which can be downloaded by running a few installation scripts in the `UnrealEngine` project that download the engine and game files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Option 2: Install Using Unreal Launcher\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also install Unreal Engine through the [Unreal Launcher](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting a Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting a project, make sure to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load **static content**\n",
    "2. Enable **raytracing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to pick a template project from the project browser, such as a first-person or a third-person game. Once the new project opens a `.uproject` file is created in the default `~/Documents/Unreal Projects` directory. We can click this file directly to open the project to continue where we left it off in the future.\n",

    "### Translation and Snap Tools\n",

    "### Working with Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to add objects to the scene. The first is through **Add Object** in the top-left corner. \n",
    "\n",
    "Click ![](../../assets/game_development/unreal_engine_first_steps/add_object.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "Click ![](../../assets/game_development/unreal_engine_first_steps/content_drawer.png) or use shortcut <kbd class=\"inline\">Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class=\"inline\">‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ Space ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎</kbd>\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter method is for adding custom game objects (blueprints as well as 2D/3D assets and more).\n",
    "\n",
    "We often need to see where a particular game asset is located in the Content Drawer. The shortcut to find any object inside the Content Drawer is <kbd class=\"inline\">Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class=\"inline\">B</kbd> while having the object selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the assets that make up our game, such as custom 3D assets, custom blueprints (code), etc are stored within the `/Content` folder of the project.\n",
