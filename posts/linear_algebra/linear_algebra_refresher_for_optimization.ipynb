    "Set convexity is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition:** &nbsp; A set $C \\subseteq \\mathbb{R^d}$ is **convex** if, for all points $x_1,x_2 \\in C$ and any $\\theta \\in [0,1]$, the point $\\theta x_1 + (1-\\theta) x_2$ is also in $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, a set is convex if the parametrized line segment between $x_1$ and $x_2$, any two points (or, more generally, vectors) in the set is also entirely inside the set.\n",

    "### Operations that Preserve Convexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling, skewing, and rotation (which can be thought of as *linear transformations*) preserve convexity as does shifting (an *affine transformation*). Let the matrix $A$ define such a transformation, and $b$ be a shift vector. Then $C' = \\{Ax + b : x \\in C \\}$ is convex provided that $C$ was convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "An *intersection* of convex sets is also convex. That is, $C' = \\{ x : x \\in C_1 \\cap x \\in C_2 \\}$ is convex provided that $C_1$ and $C_2$ were convex to begin with. The proof follows directly from the definition of intersection.\n",
    "\n",

Hence, $c_1 \\in C_2$ since $C_2 = \\bigcap^{i=1 \\to n}C^{i}$. Similarly, it can be shown that any $c_2 \\in C_2$ also belongs to $C_1$. \n",

Since the dot-product between perpendicular vectors is $0$, $\\{ x :  a^T x = 0\\}$ is simply the set of all vectors perpendicular to $a$ (whose tail, as with all vectors in linear algebra, is considered to be fixed at the origin), making $a$ the *normal vector* to the hyperplane passing through the origin. To allow for parallel hyperplanes that are translated from the origin, the *offset* $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is introduced in the generalization $\\{ x : a^T x = b \\}$. This is now the set of all vectors whose dot-product with $a$ is constant. These vectors are not quite perpendicular to $a$, but they form a parallel hyperplane that's been shifted from the origin by a distance of $\\frac{|b|}{\\|a\\|_2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the sum $a_1 x_1 + ... a_n x_n = b$ is fixed, the last coordinate, which we'll call $x_k$ for some $k \\in [1,...,n]$, is fixed by the choice of the other $n-1$ coordinates. Therefore, a hyperplane  in $\\mathbb{R^n}$ spans $n-1$ dimensions instead of $n$.\n",
