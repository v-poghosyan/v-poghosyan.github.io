# About this site
Hi there, I'm Vahram,

This is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history?ref=ideasurg.pub), my notes on the internet. I started them in late 2021 from some college notes I took using Jupyter Notebooks (and from some online material I learned during my free time). Recently, I started trying out various static page generators (namely [quarto](https://github.com/quarto-dev)) to convert my notes into a form that looks presentable in a browser. I do my best communicating which part of my work is original and which is borrowed (with citation). Please refer to the copyright section for more details on how this content shoud be used.
