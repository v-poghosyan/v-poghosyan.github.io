# About this site
Hi there, I'm Vahram. 

These are my notes on the internet. I started them in late 2021 from some university notes I took in Jupyter Notebooks (and online material I was learning in my free time). None of this is intended as original work, although some of it may be (and I will try to clearly communicate that where possible). Please refer to the copyright note below for more details. More recently I started using various static page generators (such as [quarto](https://github.com/quarto-dev)) to convert my notes into a form that looks presentable in a browser while preserving the interactibility of Jupyter Notebooks.
