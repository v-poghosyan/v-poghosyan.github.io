### ðŸ“™ About this blog

This blog is where I write about the subjects that interest me. It's where I collect my notes and ideas on the web. I started it in late 2021 from some notes I took in Jupyter Notebooks. 

Most of the content will be centered around machine learning, however I will expand into other subject areas as well. In the spirit of AI (and scalability of this blog) the thumbnails and other images featured in it are mainly generated using DALL-E.

The contents are further fed into an LLM (perhaps [llama2](https://huggingface.co/blog/llama2#demo)) through my project [jarvis]() which trains the model and makes it specialized within the subject matters of this blog. The LLM is then the accumulation of knowledge in the outside world and my own domain knowledge.

How can such a thing be built? Well, I'm glad you asked. I will be writing about the process of building jarvis in a future [post](/blog/posts/machine_learning/build_jarvis_your_own_ai_assistant.ipynb). Stay tuned! ðŸ‘€
