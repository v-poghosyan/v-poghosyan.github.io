    "# Shell Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "In Unix-like operating systems, **shells** like **Bash** and **Zsh** use **configuration files** to set up the user's environment. These files control everything from environment variables, command aliases, shell options, custom functions, and more... Understanding the differences between these files helps in customizing and managing your shell environment effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, we need to distinguish between **interactive login shells** and **interactive non-login shells**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive Login Shells vs Non-Login Shells\n",
    "\n",
    "A **login shell** is a shell session that starts when you log into your system, either directly or remotely. Itâ€™s called a \"login shell\" because it is associated with an initial user login.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of login shells:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logging in via console (i.e. keyboard & mouse) or SSH into a physical or a virtual machine (or any kind of remote server)\n",
    "- Executing `bash --login` or `zsh --login` to start a shell as a login shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose and common settings in login shells:**\n",
    "- **Environment variables:** Often, login shells set environment variables like `PATH`, `EDITOR`, and others that should be configured only once per session\n",
    "- **Startup Commands:** Commands that need to run only once per session (commonly used for setting up session-specific services) \n",
    "\n",
    "Non-login shells, then, are shells that aren't login shells. Now that we have a better understanding of the different kinds of shells, let's proceed with the comparison of the shell configuration files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bash vs Zsh Configuration Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a detailed comparison of these shell configuration files.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### `.bashrc` vs `.bash_profile`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `.bashrc`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Purpose\n",
    "Configuration file for **interactive non-login** Bash shells\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### Typical contents\n",
    "- Aliases (e.g., `alias ll='ls -alF'`)\n",
    "- Shell options (e.g., `shopt -s histappend`)\n",
    "- Functions and prompt customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `.bash_profile`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Purpose\n",
    "Configuration file for **interactive login** Bash shells\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Typical contents\n",
    "- Environment variables (e.g., `export PATH=...`)\n",
    "- Commands that should run only once at login.\n",
    "- Often includes sourcing `.bashrc` to ensure non-login shell configurations are available.\n",
    "  - To source `.bashrc`, use:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then\n",
    "      . ~/.bashrc\n",
    "    fi\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### `.zshrc` vs `.zprofile`\n",
    "\n",
    "These files are the analogs of `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` and the distinction between then is also analogous, One's for non-login shells and the other's for login shells. One key difference is that unlike `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` is is *also* sourced in login shells by default (eliminating the need to source it from `.zprofile`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### `.bash_history` vs `.zsh_history`\n",
    "\n",
    "These files store the command history for Bash or Zsh shells, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `.bash_history`\n",
    "- Used by the history command (`history`)\n",
    "- Configurable via shell variables like `HISTSIZE`, `HISTFILESIZE`, and `HISTCONTROL`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `.zsh_history`\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality\n",
    "- Used by the history command (`history`).\n",
    "- Configurable via options like `HISTSIZE`, `SAVEHIST`, and `HISTFILE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Login and Non-Login Shell Execution Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Bash\n",
    "**Login Shell:**\n",
    "  - Reads `/etc/profile` (system-wide configurations).\n",
    "  - Reads the first found file among `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login`, or `~/.profile`.\n",
    "**Non-login Interactive Shell:**\n",
    "  - Reads `~/.bashrc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Zsh\n",
    "\n",
    "**Login Shell:**\n",
    "  - Reads `/etc/zprofile` (system-wide configurations).\n",
    "  - Reads `~/.zprofile`.\n",
    "  - Then proceeds to read `~/.zshrc` (unlike Bash, Zsh reads `.zshrc` for login shells by default).\n",
    "**Interactive Shell:**\n",
    "  - Reads `~/.zshrc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Centralize Configurations\n",
    "- For Bash, source `.bashrc` from `.bash_profile` to ensure configurations are consistent across login and non-login shells.\n",
    "- For Zsh, since `.zshrc` is read by both login and interactive shells, you can place most configurations there.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Environment Variables\n",
    "Set in `.bash_profile` or `.zprofile` for variables that should be set once per session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aliases and Custom Functions\n",
    "Place in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` as they are needed for interactive use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### `.bash_profile` Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# .bash_profile\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set environment variables\n",
    "export PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n",
    "export EDITOR=\"vim\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Source .bashrc if it exists\n",
    "if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then\n",
    "    . ~/.bashrc\n",
    "fi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `.bashrc` Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# .bashrc\n",
    "\n",
    "# Aliases\n",
    "alias ll='ls -alF'\n",
    "alias gs='git status'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prompt customization\n",
    "PS1='[\\u@\\h \\W]\\$ '\n",
    "\n",
    "# Shell options\n",
    "shopt -s histappend\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `.zshrc` Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```zsh\n",
    "# .zshrc\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load Oh My Zsh\n",
    "export ZSH=\"$HOME/.oh-my-zsh\"\n",
    "ZSH_THEME=\"agnoster\"\n",
    "plugins=(git docker kubectl)\n",
    "source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "# Aliases\n",
    "alias k='kubectl'\n",
    "alias d='docker'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prompt customization\n",
    "PROMPT='%n@%m %1~ %# '\n",
    "\n",
    "# History settings\n",
    "HISTSIZE=10000\n",
    "SAVEHIST=10000\n",
    "HISTFILE=~/.zsh_history\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shell History\n",
    "Both Bash and Zsh allow you to configure how commands are saved to history files. You can prevent certain commands from being saved or set up shared history between sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sourcing Configurations from Other Files\n",
    "Use the `source` or `.` command to include configurations from other files. This helps in modularizing your shell configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Portability\n",
    "Be cautious when using shell-specific features if you switch between shells (like between Bash and Zsh). You can use `.profile` for environment variables to maintain compatibility across different shells if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison in Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bash**:\n",
    "  - `.bash_profile`: For login shells; set environment variables and startup programs.\n",
    "  - `.bashrc`: For interactive non-login shells; set aliases, functions, and shell options.\n",
    "  - `.bash_history`: Stores command history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Zsh**:\n",
    "  - `.zprofile`: For login shells; serves the same function as `.bash_profile`.\n",
    "  - `.zshrc`: For all interactive shells; configure shell environment.\n",
    "  - `.zsh_history`: Stores command history."
