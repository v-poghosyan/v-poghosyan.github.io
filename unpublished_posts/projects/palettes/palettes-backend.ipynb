    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the process of building a backend for a frontend project called Palletes ([github/vahram-pg/pallets](https://vahram-pg.github.io/palettes)). This was one of the first projects I created to learn React. Creating a backend for it will be a useful exercise in backend engineering (where we're often given an existing frontend to integrate with). The goal is to create a robust API and data layers that can handle various operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Palletes project is a web application that allows users to create and manage color palettes. The frontend is built using React, and we will be adding a Node backend using Express. In the process we will use OpenAPI to document our API, and we will also implement a database to store the color palettes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also explore serverless backend options using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB, as well as deploying the backend to a cloud provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grokking the Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's examine the functional requirements of the Palletes project. The frontend allows users to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- View existing color palettes\n",
    "- Create a new color palette (pick a name and emoji for it)\n",
    "- Edit an existing color palette (add/delete colors)\n",
    "- Delete a color palette\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {#fig-elephants layout=\"[1,1]\"}\n",
    "![View existing palettes](./images/landing-page.png){#fig-1}\n",
    "\n",
    "![Create new color palette](./images/create-palette.png){#fig-2}\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Features  \n",

    "### API Design\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential schema to store a Palette can be found in the file [seedPalettes.js](https://github.com/v-poghosyan/palettes/blob/master/src/seedPalettes.js). Here's one example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"paletteName\": \"Material UI Colors\",\n",
    "    \"emoji\": \"ðŸŽ¨\",\n",
    "    \"id\": 1,\n",
    "    \"colors\": [\n",
    "      { \"name\": \"red\", \"color\": \"#F44336\" },\n",
    "      { \"name\": \"blue\", \"color\": \"#2196F3\" },\n",
    "      { \"name\": \"green\", \"color\": \"#4CAF50\" },\n",
    "      { \"name\": \"yellow\", \"color\": \"#FFEB3B\" },\n",
    "      { \"name\": \"purple\", \"color\": \"#9C27B0\" }\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "  }\n",
    "```\n",
    "Currently, the user defined palettes are stored in the local storage of the browser. We need to find the places we store the palettes in the frontend code and wrap them with API calls to a backend. Each UI element is its own React component (as usual), so this should be straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) to create a RESTful API layer for an application served with Node. The API will handle the following endpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GET /api/palettes`: Retrieve all palettes\n",
    "- `GET /api/palettes/:id`: Retrieve a specific palette by ID\n",
    "- `POST /api/palettes`: Create a new palette\n",
    "- `PUT /api/palettes/:id`: Update an existing palette by ID\n",
    "- `DELETE /api/palettes/:id`: Delete a palette by ID\n",
    "- `GET /api/palettes/:id/colors`: Retrieve colors of a specific palette by ID\n",
    "- `POST /api/palettes/:id/colors`: Add a color to a specific palette by ID\n",
    "- `DELETE /api/palettes/:id/colors/:colorId`: Delete a color from a specific palette by ID\n",
    "- `PUT /api/palettes/:id/colors/:colorId`: Update a color in a specific palette by ID\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backend Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a potential architecture for the backend. **Authentication**, **Request Validation**, and **Business Logic** layers can be thought of as Middleware (what's called between each API to Database call). The API Layer is the Express.js *server* that handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate *handlers*. The **Data Access Layer** interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations.\n",
    "\n",

    "    class APIGateway,FrontendApp,APILayer,Auth,Validation,BusinessLogic,DataLayer,DB node\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also add a **Caching Layer** to improve performance, especially for read-heavy operations. Redis is a popular choice, but for this project we will keep it simple and use local storage as the cache. In other words, before making a database call, we will check if the data is already in local storage. If it is, we will return it from there instead of hitting the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other thing, we can move authentication and request validation to the **API Gateway**. This way, we can keep the business logic separate from the authentication and validation logic. This is a common pattern in backend development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of API Gateway authentication include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Security perimeter: Authentication happens before requests reach your application code\n",
    "* Reduced backend load: Unauthorized requests are rejected early\n",
    "* Centralized authentication logic consistent across all services that need authentication: Implement once, secure all services\n",
    "* Standard auth methods: Support for JWT, OAuth2, API keys, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We those changes, our new server architecture looks like this:\n",
