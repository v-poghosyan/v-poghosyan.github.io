    "\n",
    "The business side of our enterprise is concerned about identifying nice problems and marketing the products the technology side hands them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Identify a Niche Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by pinpointing a specific problem within a niche market. This approach increases the likelihood of your solution standing out and effectively addressing user needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Implement Effective Marketing Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Employ content marketing, social media, and SEO to reach your target audience. Tools like [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) can assist in managing your social media presence.\n",

    "## Technical side\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the business side can push any product, it should be the goal of the tech side to deliver an MVP for any client. Hence, the technology staff should develop with the north star of re0usability in mind. It's much easier to containerize a core product and deliver it with various different requested configurations to different clients. These clients, by the way, can be internal clients as we grow as a company. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Develop a Minimal Viable Product (MVP)\n",

    "Create a basic version of a product that solves the core problem. This allows for early user feedback and iterative improvements.\n",
