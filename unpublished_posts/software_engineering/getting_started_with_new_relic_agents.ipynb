    "\n",
    "## NewRelic vs Splunk\n",
    "\n",
    "NewRelic and Splunk are both powerful tools for monitoring and observability, but they have some key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NewRelic** is more focused on **application performance monitoring** (**APM**), for which it offers a wide range of features, including **distributed tracing** (tracing the event flow across microservices).\n",
    "- **Splunk** is a more focused on log aggregation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that, there's increasingly significant overlap between them as these products grow more and gain a diverse set of features. As of the time of writing this, each has its core competencies, and the two complement (rather than compete with) each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NewRelic\n",

    "#### How Does a New Relic Agent Collect Metrics from My Application?\n",
    "\n",
    "A New Relic **agent** (which comes in many different flavors, depending on your choice of a backend language) collects metrics by either *instrumenting* your application's code or attaching to its runtime environment (e.g. on the same JVM that your Java (or Scala) application is running on). Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Instrumentation**: The agent integrates with your application at the **code** level or **runtime environment** level\n",
    "   - Code level instrumentation essentially means that the NewRelic agent is imported into the application's source code itself, giving the developer far more visibility and control over the application's logs\n",
    "   - Code level instrumentation is often called **monkey patching** and it's typically used for dynamic languages like Python or JS (which are interpreted, not compiled)\n",
    "   - However, instrumenting our code is not always practical, so NewRelic offers a more cookie-cutter solution that works right out of the box -- **runtime environment** instrumentation. This means that the agent is started with the application itself, and attaches to the running process\n",
    "   - The runtime environment level of NewRelic integration is sometimes also called **bytecode manipulation**, and it's usually the approach taken when dealing with languages like Java or Scala (statically typed, compiled languages). It's a method that inserts monitoring **hooks** into your application which collect real-time data on its health and performance\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Data Collection**: The NewRelic agent's hooks collect data on various aspects of your application's performance. They either do this automatically, by detecting the frameworks used in the application and *wrapping* key methods and functions that handle an incoming request within a framework (e.g. an API endpoint's logic implemented in an HTTP library of the given language) within the bytecode itself (in the runtime environment), or by the developer's manual addition of **instrumentation points** (which are the places in the source code where the agent will *insert* its hooks). The data collected includes **metrics**, **events**, **logs**, and **traces** (also known as **MELT**), representing the four key datapoints used in **Observability** to comprehensively monitor and understand the real-time health and performance of your microservices \n",
    "   - **Metrics** such as **response times**, number and duration of **database queries**, number and duration of **external service calls**, the **memory and CPU usage** of the application (which, actually, come from container-level logs -- i.e. Docker or Kubernetes -- than the runtime of the application itself), and **error rates**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Transmission**: The collected data is asynchronously sent to New Relic's cloud-based platform through secure communication channels. This will be explored in more detail in a separate paragraph (#TODO).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analysis and Visualization**: Once the data reaches New Relic, it is processed and made available in NewRelic. New Relic stores the data in its **New Relic Telemetry Database** (**NRDB**) across multiple clouds in the United States and the European Union. New Relic uses AWS and Azure for data storage. This data can then be used to generate **dashboards**, **alerts**, and **reports**, providing real-time insights into your application's health and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Do You Install a New Relic Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation process varies depending on the programming language and environment of your application. Below is a general step-by-step guide:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sign Up and Obtain License Key**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create an account on [New Relic's website](https://newrelic.com/).\n",
    "   - Obtain your unique license key from the New Relic dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Choose the Right Agent**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   New Relic provides agents for various languages and platforms:\n",
    "\n",
    "   | Language/Platform | Agent                                                   |\n",
    "   |-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "   | **Java**          | `newrelic.jar`                                          |\n",
    "   | **.NET**          | New Relic .NET Agent                                    |\n",
    "   | **Node.js**       | `newrelic` npm package                                  |\n",
    "   | **Python**        | `newrelic` pip package                                  |\n",
    "   | **Ruby**          | `newrelic_rpm` gem                                      |\n",
    "   | **PHP**           | New Relic PHP Agent                                     |\n",
    "   | **Go**            | New Relic Go Agent                                      |\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Install the Agent**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **For Java**:\n",
    "     - Download the `newrelic.jar` file.\n",
    "     - Add the agent to your JVM startup parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "       ```shell\n",
    "       -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **For Node.js**:\n",
    "     - Install via npm:\n",
    "\n",
    "       ```shell\n",
    "       npm install newrelic\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Require New Relic at the top of your main JavaScript file:\n",
    "\n",
    "       ```javascript\n",
    "       require('newrelic');\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **For Python**:\n",
    "     - Install via pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "       ```shell\n",
    "       pip install newrelic\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Initialize the agent in your application's entry point.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Configure the Agent**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Update the configuration file (e.g., `newrelic.yml` for Java or `newrelic.js` for Node.js) with your license key and application name.\n",
    "   - Set any additional settings like logging level or transaction tracing as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Restart Your Application**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The agent begins collecting data when the application restarts with the agent enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Verify Installation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Log in to your New Relic dashboard to confirm that data is being reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where Does It Sit in a Microservices Application?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a microservices architecture, each service operates independently, often across different environments or platforms. Here's how the New Relic agent fits in:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent in Each Microservice**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Install and configure the New Relic agent within each microservice you want to monitor.\n",
    "   - This ensures that performance data is collected at the granular level of each service.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integration Points**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Within the Application Code**: For languages like Node.js or Python, the agent is imported directly into the application code.\n",
    "   - **At the Runtime Level**: For compiled languages like Java or .NET, the agent attaches to the runtime environment via startup parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Containerized Environments**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If your microservices run in containers (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), include the agent installation and configuration in your container images.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, use sidecar containers for the agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Distributed Tracing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - New Relic supports distributed tracing, allowing you to trace requests as they flow through different microservices.\n",
    "   - Ensure that distributed tracing is enabled in the agent configuration to correlate data across services.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Aggregation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - All agents report back to New Relic's centralized platform, where data is aggregated.\n",
    "   - You can view the performance of individual microservices or the entire application stack.\n",
