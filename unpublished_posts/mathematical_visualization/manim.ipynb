    "[Manim](https://www.manim.community/) is a custom Python library for mathematical animation. It has two versions,. The first, and original, is maintained by Grant Sanderson himself (the creator of the library and the Stanford professor who goes by the username [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) on YouTube). The forked version, called the [Manim community edition](https://github.com/v-poghosyan/manim) enjoys more open source contributions and has the better documentation and support (attentiveness to PRs, etc.). For this series of posts on Manim, I will use the community edition to keep this document relevant.\n",

    "### Python virtual environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `virtualenv` (`venv`), let's create an isolated Python environment to contain the Python version and the versions of library dependencies for our Manim projects. Note that `venv` is quite old, and the new way of managing Python environments and packages is [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) (a merger of `pip` and `venv`). More on that later... For this project we'll stick with `venv` because I like having physical folders that contain the various environments used across my notes on this site. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### A note on using multiple virtual environment/package managers\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have multiple Python versions installed (through various different environment managers available for Python), do `which pip` or `which pip3` (or `which python`/`which python3`). The former, `pip`, is a package manager that comes pre-installed with a Python installation (it pulls from places like [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/4.10.0.84/)), so it will always correspond with some version of Python installed on your machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my case, `pip` corresponds to `~/anaconda3/bin/pip` (which is the Python installation that came with [Conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note title=\"Note\" appearance=\"minimal\" collapse=\"false\"}\n",
    "Note that you have to be in an active Conda environment to see any sort of meaningful output for `which pip` (assuming, of course, that there's no globally installed version on your machine that's aliased to `pip`. If there is such an aliasing, the [unalias](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=u-unalias-command) command can help). \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is an environment and package manager for Python, much like `venv` but also for managing packages (and not just environments). However, it also supports R, C++, and other languages and frameworks. This is typically useful for data science/analysis purposes, not so much in our use case. Conda also lacks support for some Manim community libraries/plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other installation, `pip3`, corresponds to `/opt/homebrew/bin/pip3` which came with the `python3` installation from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (for more on Homebrew, see this [post](../local_development_setup/brew.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on Conda see this [legacy post](../../unpublished_posts/local_development_setup/set_up_a_local_development_environment_for_ML.ipynb) (legacy posts are unpublished posts that serve as repositories of unorganized thoughts and snippets).\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-tip title=\"Note\" appearance=\"minimal\" collapse=\"false\"}\n",
    "Ultimately, having a mess of a Python environment like what we saw above is bad. Very bad. If you find yourself encountering any issues (such as certain libraries that should be installed not being recognized inside the cells, or failures being thrown that have cryptic error messages indicating the problem lies in one of these libraries) clean up your Python environment(s) by uninstalling Homebrew and Conda. For Homebrew: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Check this [README](https://github.com/homebrew/install#uninstall-homebrew) for a `CURL` to run a provided uninstaller. \n",
    "* On Apple Silicon, edit shell configuration file `~/.zprofile` (using `vim`) which sets the `$PATH` variable to give priority to Homebrew packages inside `/opt/homebrew` (for the various different shell configuration files see this [post](../local_development_setup/shell_configs.ipynb)). \n",
    "* Also remove the residual files the uninstaller leaves behind by `sudo rm -rf /opt/homebrew/`\n",
    "  \n",
    "Similar instructions exist for uninstalling [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/). At the end of this, `which python` should fail to output anything and `which python3` will correspond to `/usr/bin/python3` (where it's installed through `apt`/`yum` or shipped with the OS). Now you may install [Brew](https://brew.sh/) again, this time stick with [Python 3.9](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/python@3.9). Then stick to using `pip3.9 install <PackageName>` all the time, or make sure the `python3` in the terminal configuration is correctly linked to the version installed with Homebrew. You can do so by `unalias pip` and `alias pip=pip3.9`.  \n",

This is just what we want. Note that if we do `which pip3` or `which python3` we will still get the versions that are contained within the virtual environment because `venv` creates virtual environments with multiple versions of `pip` and `python` already installed alongside one another (including `pip3`/`python3`).\n",

    "Grant Sanderson himself defines a custom script that hooks into a local Python file defining the entire scene. The script continually parses the file looking for certain leading comments (usually before class or function definitions). It then renders the scene only up to that comment, so that the scene pauses at the part of the code he's working on (so that the state of the scene is maintained until that point). He then uses an IDE shortcut to execute that single code block (which is clearly demarcated with a leading comment) inside a Python interpreter. The interpreter then renders the relevant portion of the scene to the output window. In this way, it's possible to incrementally test parts of a scene (mimicking a Jupyter notebook setup). \n",
