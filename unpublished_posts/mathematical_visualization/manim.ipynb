    "# Manim - An introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local development environment setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Manim is a custom Python library for mathematical visualizations. It has two versions, the first version is maintained by Grant Sanderson himself (the acclaimed Stanford professor who goes by the username [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) on YouTube). And another one, a fork of the original, called the [Manim community edition](https://github.com/v-poghosyan/manim) which enjoys more contributions and has better documentation and support (in terms of attentiveness to PRs and such). For this series, I will use the community edition to help maintain this document's relevance and, possibly, contribute to the open-source community project myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (Optional) Create an isolated Python environment \n",
    "\n",
    "Using `virtualenv` (`venv`), let's create an isolated Python environment to contain the Python version and the versions of library dependencies for our Manim projects. Note that `venv` is quite old, and the new way of managing Python environments and packages is [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) (a merger of `pip` and `venv`). More on that later... For this project we'll stick with `venv` because I like having physical folders that contain the various environments used across my notes on this site. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### A note on using multiple Python virtual environment managers\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have multiple Python versions installed, do `which pip` or `which pip3` (or `which python`/`which python3`). This is a package manager that comes with a Python installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my case, `pip` corresponds to `~/anaconda3/bin/pip` (which corresponds to the Python installation from Conda). Conda is yet another environment and package manager for Python, like `venv`, but it also supports R, C++, and others. You have to be in an active Conda environment to see a meaningful output for `which pip` (assuming there's no globally installed Python version on your machine). \n",
    "\n",
    "The other one, `pip3`, corresponds to `/opt/homebrew/bin/pip3` which came with the `python3` installation from Homebrew. I won't be using Conda environments today due to their lack of support for some Manim community libraries/plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on Conda see this [legacy post](../../unpublished_posts/python/set_up_a_local_development_environment_for_ML.ipynb) (legacy posts are unpublished posts that serve as repositories of unorganized thoughts and snippets).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (Step 1) Create a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create a new virtual environment. Issue the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 -m venv manim-sandbox\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a folder `/manim-sandbox` in the project's root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (Step 2) Activate/deactivate virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate, issue command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source manim-sandbox/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which runs the `activate` script of the virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deactivate, simply do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (Step 3) Install packages into the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside an active virtual environment, issue `which pip`. The output now is: `~/Documents/github/v-poghosyan.github.io/manim-sandbox/bin/pip` which corresponds to the version of Python installed inside the project's environment folder `manim-sandbox`. This is just what we want. Note that if we do `which pip3` or `which python3` we will still get the versions that are contained within the virtual environment because `venv` creates virtual environments with multiple versions of `pip` and `python` already installed alongside one another (including `pip3`/`python3`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if we indeed have a clean slate of an environment, we can do `pip list` which should just show one package, `pip` itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Package Version\n",
    "------- -------\n",
    "pip     24.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's upgrade pip for good measure. Issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install --upgrade pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (Step 4) Exporting requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than committing the entire environment to the repository of a project, we commit a `requirements.txt` containing the output of `pip list` generated by: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the packages inside this file in a new environment, do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Manim depends on `py3cairo`, `ffmpeg` and some other dependencies for Apple Silicon machines and LaTeX support. Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install py3cairo ffmpeg\n",
    "\n",
    "# Form LaTeX support in Manim\n",
    "brew install --cask mactex-no-gui\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extra dependencies for Apple Silicon\n",
    "brew install pango pkg-config scipy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing manim and (optionally) jupyter-manim\n",
    "\n",
    "Activate the virtual environment `manim-sandbox` and do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install manimlib # or 'manim' for the original non-community version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For use in Jupyter Notebooks, there's [jupyter-manim](https://github.com/krassowski/jupyter-manim) that enables\n",
    "\n",
    "the **magic command**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%manim -qm <SceneName>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This must be provided at the top of each cell. It is similar to issuing the `manim` command in a terminal (**cell magic** is Jupyter's equivalent of that).\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-tip title=\"Note\" appearance=\"minimal\" collapse=\"false\"}\n",
    "Magic commands behave exactly like command line commands with their arguments. For example, to display `manim` help options, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%manim -h\n",
    "```\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I chose to render my manim scenes from a dedicated repository [manim-projects](https://github.com/v-poghosyan/manim-projects) (also linked in the title banner) containing a requirements.txt file with all the library dependencies for my manim projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Only occasionally, throught these notes, will I use the jupyter-manim's cell magic `%%manim` to render something in these notes. When I do, the result will be published inside the `v-poghosyan.github.io/posts/mathematical_visualization/media` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rendering a manim scene \n",
    "\n",
    "To run my manim scenes, I instead use the `manim` command from my terminal at the root `/manim-projects` directory, like so: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "manim -qm <SceneName> \n",

    "### The Grant Sanderson setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Grant himself defines a custom script that hooks into a local Python file defining the entire scene, and parses the script looking for certain leading comments. It then runs the script only up to that comment, so that the scene pauses at the last step, at the part of the code he's still working on. He then uses an IDE shortcut to execute just that single code block (clearly demarcated with comments) in a Python interpreter, which renders the relevant portion of the scene to the output window. In this way, he can incrementally test parts of the scene (mimicking a Jupyter notebook setup) \n",
