    "The same area of the brain lights up when we do spatial calculations, as when we do temporal ones, as when we calculate our attachment to a given person, animal, or a thing. This suggests that attachment consists of two brain processes, among possibly some others: spatial calculation of how to access a person, an animal, or a thing that is the object of our grief, and a temporal calculation of when we saw them last, or how soon we can access the subject."
