    "Docker's an alternative to VMs. Whereas VMs run on a Hypervisor which runs on bare metal and distributes the hardware among the guest VMs, Docker containers run inside a Docker Engine which runs on the host operating system. In other words, virtualization distributes the hardware among multiple guest operating systems whereas containerization does the same, in concept, but works on top of the host operating system while still managing to provide isolated containers each running its own OS."
