    "React Three Fiber is a React wrapper for Three.js, which allows us to use Three.js in a React application. It provides a way to create and manage 3D scenes using React components, making it easier to integrate 3D graphics into React applications. In this post, we will explore how to use React Three Fiber with [Theater.js](https://www.theatrejs.com/), a library for creating animations and interactive experiences in the browser. Theater.js basically provides a rich CG editor (like Blender) in the browser which lets us translate/scale or otherwise transform 3D objects, use animation curves, and keyframes, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Theater.js\n",
    "\n",
    "Theater.js is composed of two main parts and many optional extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Core: The core of Theater.js is a JavaScript library that provides the runtime for Theater.js code (which is just a wrapper on top of Three.js, which is, by extension, a wrapper of WebGL).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    npm install @theatre/core\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    In fact, when we use Theater to update the position of a 3D object, we explicitly set up a listener in Theater.js that picks up the changes and passes them down to Three.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Studio: The Studio is a web-based editor that allows users to create and edit Theater.js projects visually. It provides a user interface for manipulating 3D objects, creating animations, and managing scenes. We take this library out in the production version of our app (hence we may only install it as a dev dependency).\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    npm install @theatre/studio\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Extensions: There are many extensions that let us customize our workflow! For example, [@theater/r3f](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@theatre/r3f) is a UI tool called a \"snapshot editor\" that extends the functionality of the studio library. It includes the translation tools, rotation tools, and scaling tools that bringing the experience much closer to that of using a 3D editor (like Blender). It works with React Three Fiber created scenes...\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of React Three Fiber, we need to understand what it is and how it differs from Three.js.\n",

    "React Three Fiber is a very thin wrapper over Three.js that allows us to use Three.js in a React application. It provides a way to create and manage 3D scenes using React components. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means we create our objects (meshes)a\\ and other scene elements in a reactive way using React's component system and lifecycle management. There is no need to manually delete meshes (garbage collect) like there is in Three.js (using `dispose`) because React Three Fiber handles this for us through React's lifecycle management. Let's see Three.js and React Three Fiber side by side. \n",

    "R3F follows these conventions and principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every child component in R3F is appended to its parent (after R3F code is \"compiled\" into Three.js) using the Three.js's `add` method.\n",
    "2. In Three.js, using vanilla JS, we create objects like a `Mesh` by instantiating the class with the right arguments passed into the constructor. In R3F, we create objects like a `Mesh` by using the `<mesh>` component and passing the *props* to it.\n",
    "3. The only exception to (1) are the geomeries and materials components, which are passed as props to the `<mesh>` component rather than being attached (like a camera to a scene, for example). Although, in R3F, they still appear (like everything else in JSX) to be nested w.r.t the another component. The child components that get attached this way implement an `attach` property in their internal R3F implementations. This `attach` property can be used to attach more than just the geometry and material propeties of Three.js objects... Essentially, R3F treats the Three.js `Mesh` object as a component, but also some of ts props are also treated as reactive components in themselves (since React is component-centered)\n",
    "* The `<Canvas>` component is not the HTML Canvas, it's an R3F wrapper component that sets up the Three.js scene, camera, and renderer. It is the root component of a Three.js scene in R3F. It already includes a default renderer, camera, and scene (whereas in Three.js, we had to create these manually). It also creates the animation loop for us, so we don't have to call `requestAnimationFrame` manually. This is consistent with the reactive programming paradigm of React -- where the UI is updated automatically with state changes. So, the R3F `<Canvas>` effectively abstracts the animation loop, scene, camera, and renderer (things we rarely have to mess with). We can still manually manage a camera by passing it as a prop to the `<Canvas>` component however (see [R3F Canvas docs](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/api/canvas)).\n",
    "* R3F follows React's same naming convention. React uses lower case for JSX elements that are primitives (like `<div>`, `<h1>`, etc.). R3F follows the same convention, it lowercases the components that are primitive with respect to Three.js (rather than HTML itself). So, `<mesh>` is a React component that represents a Three.js `three.Mesh` object. And, in general, every Three.js object, say `ThreeJsObject`, has a corresponding R3F component like `threeJsObject`.\n"
