Hi, I’m Vahram!

Welcome to my digital garden — a collection of my notes and ideas shared on the internet.

This journey began in early 2021, inspired by some college notes I had compiled using Jupyter Notebooks and various online resources I explored during my free time. Recently, I’ve been experimenting with static page generators (like Quarto) to transform my notes into a format that’s both functional and visually appealing for the web.

I strive to clearly distinguish between original work and borrowed content, always providing proper citations where applicable. For more details on content usage and attribution, please refer to the Copyright section.
