Setup Your Environment\n\nFirst, you need to set up your Python environment. This involves installing necessary libraries and tools, including Hugging Face's Transformers library.\n\n```bash\npip install transformers\n```\n\n### 2. Prepare Your Training Data\nYour training data will be your local notes. If they're hosted on GitHub, you can clone the repository to your local machine. If they're served as static pages, you can use a web scraper to download the notes.\n\n### 3. Preprocess Your Data\nBefore training the model, you need to preprocess your data. This involves tokenizing the text and formatting it in a way that the model can understand.\n\n### 4. Train the Model\nNow you're ready to train the model. You can use Hugging Face's `Trainer` class to do this. Here's a basic example:\n\n### 5. Upload the Model to Hugging Face\nAfter training the model, you can upload it to Hugging Face's Model Hub. This allows others to use your model for their own tasks.\n\n## Conclusion\nThat's it! You've now trained an open source LLM with your local notes and uploaded it to Hugging Face.
